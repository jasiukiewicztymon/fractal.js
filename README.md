# fractal.js

The idea of the project is to make the js code modifiable. For example in a given problem where you want to parse a pseudo-directive in Js, you cannot access it easily.. The idea of `fractal.js` is to parse a js function as 
a callstack and use it to create a class with element called `element` *(can be deffined with an arrowed function)*. Each call would be a block of code of a definited type: `loop`, `statement`, `initialisation`, `call` and `operation`.
